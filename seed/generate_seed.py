"""SonicWave source-data seed generator.

Generates three daily source snapshots (T, T+1, T+2) for two SonicWave
tables and writes them, through a Spark session, into a local landing folder:

    <output>/<table>/<snapshot_date>/part-*.json

This is the *raw source* your ingestion pipeline consumes — the daily drop a
source system leaves for you. It is deliberately **permissive and messy**:
everything lands as text (JSON strings), and each snapshot carries real-world
problems your pipeline has to survive — new rows, a late-arriving event, a
dimension attribute that changes, and a handful of malformed rows.

**Every row carries two source timestamps:**

    created_at   when the source row was born (never null)
    updated_at   when it was last changed -- NULL if it has never changed
                 since creation. So `updated_at IS NULL` means "still in its
                 original state"; a non-null value marks a real update.

Together they give you a proper change signal: order SCD2 versions by
`coalesce(updated_at, created_at)`. For `plays`, `created_at` is the source
*record* time, so a **late** play has `played_at` on an earlier day than its
`created_at` (recorded a day after it happened).

The two tables and what each one is here to make you handle:

    plays     high-volume EVENT feed  -> partition-overwrite idempotency;
                                         a LATE event (played_at < created_at);
                                         plus a duplicate id + malformed rows
                                         (negative / non-numeric duration, null
                                         user) to dedup and quarantine
    users     SCD2 DIMENSION          -> a tracked attribute CHANGES across days
                                         (updated_at flips from null to a time);
                                         plus a duplicate row + a null-email row
                                         to dedup and quarantine

Run it:

    uv run python seed/generate_seed.py                 # -> ./data/source
    uv run python seed/generate_seed.py --output ./data/source

**This seed is yours.** Change it, add rows, invent a specific edge case you
want your pipeline to prove it handles — the data below is a starting point,
not a fixed input.
